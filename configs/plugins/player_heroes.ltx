; This plugin determines the default settings for the character creator.
; When the character creator is first opened during a session a random hero is selected.
; Should this plugin fail to load, then it will default to hardcoded settings for Strelok.

; Note: If the character creator crashes after making changes here it's because you've used an invalid faction, so look for typos!
; Check the "communities" attribute in the "configs\creatures\game_relations.ltx" file for the technical names of all in-game factions.
