; This plugin details the recoil effects of weapons when the enhanced recoil feature is enabled.
; Each weapon should have a section of the same name here, with its name also listed in the "enhanced_recoil" section.

; Speed of camera movement can be altered with the "speed" attribute.
; Values should be "1" for high-RPM MGs, "2" for slow-RPM MGs or heavy weapons, and "3" for shotguns.
; If an invalid number is provided then it will default to whichever is nearest to that given.

; Effect multipliers are set separately for when the actor is zoomed in or out of their weapon.
; The attributes for these are "zoom_in_effects" and "zoom_out_effects" respectively.
; Per shot a random value from those provided will be chosen for the recoil calculation.

; Two additional "global" zoom multipliers exist, but it isn't advised to use them.
; Said multipliers are "zoom_in_multi" and "zoom_out_multi".

; An additional multiplier also exists to strengthen/weaken the effects of recoil reduction via upgrades.
; The higher the "upgrade_multi" value, the more of a dampening effect said upgrades will have (and vice versa).
