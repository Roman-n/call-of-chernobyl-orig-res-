			%c[guide_blue]AI die to anomalies%c[default] removes anomalies as a factor in the AI's pathfinding.\n
			\n%c[guide_green]Information%c[default]
			\nWith this feature enabled mutants and other stalkers will lose their clairvoyant ability to know exactly where anomalies are located.\n
			\nAs such, they will now find themselves placed at the full mercy of the Zone's environment no different from your own character.\n
			\nThis feature can be toggled from the game options menu and is disabled by default.

			\n%c[guide_green]Information%c[default]
			\nWith this feature enabled having the best artefacts is no-longer the end of the line for artefact hunters.\n

			%c[guide_blue]Delayed repairs%c[default] allows technicians to retain your equipment.\n
			\n%c[guide_green]Information%c[default]
			\nWith this feature enabled, broken weapons, outfits, and other items which you bring to a technician will be kept in their possession until they have completed all repairs.\n
			\nAfter handing over your items you can speak with the technician again to ask whether they are ready for pick-up, to which they will either return them or tell you how much time is still required.\n
			\nThis adds a somewhat realistic enhancement to the traditional repair system, suitable if you are seeking a harder experience, as it will no-longer work instantaneously and instead emphasise the use of gunsmith and sewing kits.\n
			\nThis feature can be toggled from the game options menu and is disabled by default.

			%c[guide_blue]Online exclusion%c[default] creates a no-spawn zone around your character.\n
			\n%c[guide_green]Information%c[default]
			\nAs you explore near the edges of levels and their entry/exit points you could be attacked by enemies arriving from other levels. With online exclusion enabled these spawns are delayed until you are safely out of the way.\n
			\nIt should be noted that this system revolves entirely around you; any enemies already at a location whilst you are changing levels will not be de-spawned upon your arrival.\n
			\nThis feature can be adjusted from the game options menu and is set to 25 by default.

			%c[guide_blue]Population factors%c[default] modify the number of stalkers and mutants found in the Zone.\n
			\n%c[guide_green]Information%c[default]
			\nStalker and mutant population factors can be adjusted independently from one another, allowing you to decide how wild or settled the Zone should be without the need to modify any of the game's files.\n
			\nIt should be noted that the effect is greatest when starting a new character, as if the factors are changed during a playthrough in progress, they will only be realised as stalkers and/or mutants die and then respawn in greater or smaller numbers.\n
			\nThese features can be adjusted from the game options menu and are set to 0.5 by default.

			%c[guide_blue]Sleep deprivation%c[default] allows time and the use of consumables to fatigue your character.\n
			\n%c[guide_green]Information%c[default]
			\nThroughout the Zone you will find many beds and sleeping bags, normally they are only used to allow you to skip time by sleeping, however with this feature enabled they become an essential part of gameplay.\n
			\nAs time passes your character will slowly begin to feel tired, with the screen beginning to blur and shake. These effects will proceed to get worse until you find a suitable place to rest or the effects of sleep deprivation cause you to collapse from exhaustion.\n
			\nTiredness can be accelerated through consuming items such as medical kits and vodka, and negated with those such as high-caffeine energy drinks - however using too many will leave you unable to rest until their effects wear off.\n
			\nThis feature can be toggled from the game options menu and is disabled by default.
