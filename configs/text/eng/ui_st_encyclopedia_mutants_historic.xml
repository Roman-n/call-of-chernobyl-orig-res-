			%c[guide_blue]Tarks%c[default] are extinct horse-like creatures, likely mutated from the Przewalski's horse.\n
			\n%c[guide_green]Information%c[default]
			\nThis creature bore little resemblance to its ancestors due to massive exposure to radiation upon the Zone's inception.\n
			\nIts hind legs were atrophied whereas those at its anterior had become visibly exaggerated, whilst its tail and much of its mouth had all but decayed or disappeared.\n
			\nSimilar in ways to a flesh, the tark's body was greatly swollen and bloated, and were also frequently seen hunting in large groups - though probably as more of an instinctual relic than any regular form of a herd.\n
			\nUnlike other mutants in the Zone they were incredibly feral animals, with their madness often overwhelming their perception of fear and likely contributing to their species' eventual downfall.\n
